# Phase One phone test log

Device: Realme RM10, Android 11, serial <DEVICE_SERIAL>. Owner pastes his own OpenRouter key; it is never read or recorded here.
Rule: start `adb logcat -s EqoRun EqoActions` into a file before the owner tests; record each test below with the build commit.

## 2026-10-06

| Time (IST) | Build | Request / action | Result | Evidence | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~15:43 | PR #74 head 3133f6a (CI APK) | Typed "Open Keep Notes and search for opencode", Plan | "Could not reach the model" twice. Phone network fine (ping openrouter.ai ~57 ms). Cause not found; later plans worked after the owner re-entered the key and re-enabled accessibility. | screenshots, ping | none; likely accessibility/key state after reinstall |
| ~15:48 | 3133f6a | Same request, plan approved | Plan shown correctly (OPEN_APP "Keep Notes", WAIT, TYPE_TEXT "Search your notes", PRESS_ENTER). Step 1 OPEN_APP failed (`execution_failed`) twice, 1.4 s then 0.1 s. Reason not logged in that build. | EqoRun log | added short failure reason to EqoRun (commit c2dd4e4) |
| ~22:11 | PR #79 test build 375590c (#74 + #78) | Same request | Step 1 OPEN_APP succeeded and Keep opened. Step 3 TYPE_TEXT failed: 15 retries "node_found=false", then PartialApply, status FAILED. Real field label is "Search Keep" (EditText, resource id com.google.android.keep:id/toolbar); planner guessed "Search your notes". | EqoRun log | fix: type into the only text input when the hint does not match (commit df7ad13); with several inputs it still refuses to guess |
| ~23:00 | df7ad13 | Owner ran the request; reported typing still failing in search fields | NOT captured (capture started 23:14; phone log rolled over). | none | live capture started |
| 23:28 | df7ad13 | Keep Notes search (captured) | OPEN_APP ok, WAIT ok, TYPE_TEXT found the "Search Keep" EditText and reported action_accepted in 24 ms, then USER_TAKEOVER latched 52 ms later and the run paused. The bar opens a separate search page, so the text never reached the real field. | eqorun-live.log 23:28:00 | fix af0ace9: wait 700 ms, check the focused field, retype into it if empty; 600 ms grace for EQO's own touch signals |
| 23:29 | df7ad13 | SEND_WHATSAPP (captured) | READ_CONTACTS requested; TYPE_TEXT accepted; result UserActionRequired, then takeover latched and status FAILED. | eqorun-live.log 23:29:06-11 | WhatsApp send path needs its own check |
| 23:30 | df7ad13 | Open app + READ_MESSAGES (captured) | Completed. | eqorun-live.log 23:30:03-09 | none |
| 23:31 | df7ad13 | Keep search, second try (captured) | TYPE_TEXT NodeNotFound x15 once (screen state), then on retry accepted again and takeover latched 51-52 ms after, same pattern as 23:28. | eqorun-live.log 23:31, 23:32 | same fix af0ace9 |
| 23:57-23:58 | af0ace9 | Open Google Meet (captured) | `reason=App 'meet' not installed` (correct: Meet is not installed on this phone). | eqorun-live.log | none |
| 01:06-01:25 | af0ace9 | Search boxes in Keep, Gmail, Zepto (captured, owner report) | TYPE_TEXT found an EditText but Android rejected set-text and paste (`ActionRejected`), at 01:06, 01:07, 01:21, 01:25. Typing worked in Flipkart search, a message field and a new-mail compose field. | eqorun-live.log; owner report | commit 3350a47: rejected first attempt now gets the confirm-and-retype pass; log carries widget id and flags |
| 01:09 | af0ace9 | Open a URL | OPEN_URL succeeded, run COMPLETED. | eqorun-live.log | none |
| 01:18-01:20 | af0ace9 | Gmail flow: OPEN_APP, WAIT, READ_EMAILS, then a tap | READ_EMAILS ok; the following tap_text step NodeNotFound x16, run FAILED. | eqorun-live.log | needs the plan text to see the target; planner/step diagnostics |
| 01:22 | af0ace9 | Send email | SEND_EMAIL succeeded (draft opened). | eqorun-live.log | none |
| 01:30 | af0ace9 | "Open calculator and find 2345678 * 8765432" | OPEN_APP, WAIT, CALCULATE all Success. CALCULATE evaluates inside EQO and never types into the Calculator app. Owner reports the Calculator showed "238 * 800", not the requested numbers; the plan text and result line were not captured. | eqorun-live.log | open: find where "238 * 800" came from (plan param vs display); decide whether Calculator should be driven by taps or the answer shown in EQO |
Owner summary 2026-10-07 ~01:30: opening apps, sending SMS/WhatsApp messages and calls work; typing fails in some search boxes (Notes, Gmail, Zepto).
| 02:01-02:03 | af0ace9 (CI) | Keep search via debug plan (no key) | Passed: CLICK_TEXT toolbar, TYPE_TEXT into `search_actionbar_query_text`, PRESS_ENTER, COMPLETED. | eqorun-live.log | debug plan receiver added (debug builds only) |
| 02:03 | af0ace9 | Gmail search via debug plan | First TYPE_TEXT hit `open_search` (ActionRejected), retype landed in `open_search_view_edit_text`; COMPLETED. | eqorun-live.log | none |
| 09:18 | local b360a56 | Zepto search | Search is a Button with a text child, no EditText: tap-then-type fallback worked; COMPLETED. | eqorun-live.log | fix b360a56 + step-budget ordering |
| 09:20 | local | Calculator keys (12 x 3 =) | Passed with real labels (digits, Multiply, Equals, Clear). Earlier "238 x 800" was leftover state in the Calculator, not typed by EQO. | eqorun-live.log; screenshot | planner hints added (fbf4fbb) |
| 11:14-11:17 | 21de750 (#74+#78+#77+#81) | LIST_MACROS, DETECT_ROUTINES, READ_NOTIFICATIONS via debug plan | All three Success (notification content not verified; access not granted). | eqorun-live.log | #81 needs notification-access check |
| 11:52 | 21de750 | BROWSER_NAVIGATE https://example.com, consent allowed, Chrome flag + command-line file set | Chrome launched with the DevTools socket present, but EQO reported "Android did not allow EQO to connect to Chrome's DevTools socket". Consent was first reset by a stray test tap (lead error). | screenshot; /proc/net/unix | #78 not merged as working; needs adb-forward through the helper |
| 12:15 | 21de750 | Wireless pairing (split screen) | PAIR, CONNECT, HELPER_START passed; AUTHORIZE failed (`StepFailed`), BINDER_HEALTH not run. Pairing screen says "Paired and connected"; hub row "Needs attention". Cause: Shizuku.checkSelfPermission never granted, no prompt exists. Pinned-key risk resolved (first connect matches on Realme). | eqorun-live.log 12:31, 12:34 | card t_91b2a02e (helper authorization prompt) |
Merged to main 2026-10-07: #74 (65a884f), #77 (29bad15). Open: #78 parked, #81 awaiting rebase, UX #83 in progress.

## Known failing (as of df7ad13)
- Typing into some apps' search fields (Keep reported by owner after the sole-input fix; cause unknown until captured).
- Contact search inside apps, WhatsApp voice calls, MAKE_CALL permission: not yet fixed.

## Not tested on a phone yet
- Wireless pairing (#77), Chrome control (#78), notifications/macros/routines (#81), voice input.
